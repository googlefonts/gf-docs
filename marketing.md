# Promo / Marketing
{:.no_toc}

> <span class="icon">ü¶ï</span>  When a font is released for the first time on Google Fonts, or if it benefited from a major upgrade, we will tweet to promote it from [@googlefonts](https://twitter.com/googlefonts).
> In order to tweet about a new release, Google Fonts requires 2-3 expressive images different from the ones used in the [README file](readme.md), which usually correspond to a sample image with a different size. If the Family is variable, an animation is welcome. See [this tweet](https://twitter.com/googlefonts/status/1487038395918565377) as an example.

## What the designer should provide

-   Both the images and the source files of the images should be included in the promo folder under the documentation dir.
-   The promotional images should be following the [Google Assets Figma template](https://www.figma.com/file/RwEesMz0S2xXBp0uGi62ft/GF-Asset-template-for-external-partners?node-id=0%3A1). If the project is commissioned by Google Fonts, this is mandatory. Otherwise, it is a kind request for our preference.
-   If the font was designed for a particular script or language, some localized text should be added addressing the respective script or language.
-   Authors‚Äô names will be included, preferable by tagging them. Person tags can be provided in the README.md or a .txt file in documentation dir.
-   Please provide a compilation image plus one for each family when a project includes many sibling families. According to the project's complexity, we would decide on the strategy to promote them either as a set or independently.

## How the tweet will be written

-   Type of release: New font (‚ÄùNew font!‚Äù) / Upgraded Font (‚ÄúGood News!‚Äù).
-   Font Name and tag to author.
-   Key aspects of the font (axes and ranges included or special features).
-   Link to family on Google Fonts.
-   Link to a mini website if available.

The person onboarding the project will collect images from the documentation directory, include them in a drive folder, write a little tweet according to a simple template, and then it will be reviewed and published when the font is released on the live server.
