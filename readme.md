# README file
{:.no_toc}

> <span class="icon">ü¶¶</span>  The README.md is a page you find at the root of any repository. It is the first readable text that a user can see when arriving in the repository on GitHub‚Äôs website.
> This page will help designers to write a good README file.
> -   GF wants to encourage you to share anything you think may be interesting or relevant about your typeface‚Äîthe inspiration, process, challenges you encountered, etc. So this is your moment. You can go wild and write a complete article if you feel like it.
> -   Take into account that this file will be taken as the base information that would be used to create the [Description file](description.md) that feeds the `#About` section of the specimen page of your font(s) on `fonts.google.com/Family+Name#about`.
>    Eg. **Roboto** <https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto#about>
>    As a designer, you don‚Äôt have to care much about creating the description file, as the actual team member who will onboard the font will be able to do it if your `README.md` is well developed.

## What to include

The informations you provide in your font project‚Äôs `README.md` is key for GF and for users. It is therefore mandatory to apply the following instructions. Whilst only you can judge what makes sense or not for your font description in term of detail and length, we can only recommend you to be generous with them:

-   **The name of your font as the title**
-   **A concise description that resumes the key points:**

    -   One or two key descriptor(s) (e.g. variable, minimal, grotesque, etc).

    

    -   Why it was created and what it‚Äôs designed to do.

    

    -   Notable characteristics and features.

    

    -   Anything extra you want people to know.

    

    -   Scripts (e.g. Latin, Cyrillic, etc).

    Example:

    > *Roboto Serif is a variable typeface family designed to create a comfortable and frictionless reading experience. Minimal and highly functional, it is useful anywhere (even for app interfaces) due to the extensive set of weights and widths across a broad range of optical sizes. While it was carefully crafted to work well in digital media, across the full scope of sizes and resolutions we have today, it is just as comfortable to read and work in print media.*
-   **At least one image displaying the font (name, glyphset, notable features).**

    Typefaces are a visual product, images are therefore mandatory for the `README.md`. GF also may use them for the `#about` section of your font family specimen page on Google Fonts.
-   **Further research and process definition.**
-   **Further development on special features and language support.**
-   **A Build section with detailed instructions on how to build the fonts.**
-   **A Changelog**

    List all the changes of the relevant upgrades indicating dates of release and font version numbers.
-   **Acknowledgements and credits**

    List of all the authors and contributors to the project, the role they played, and additional information such as profession, email, website.
-   **A mention to the licence**

## Concrete examples

You may get inspire by these examples to build up your `README.md`. Please note that none is actually perfect, and ideally, you should combine the best part of them all if relevant to your project.
