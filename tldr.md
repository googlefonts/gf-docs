# Google Fonts Guide TL;DR

> <span class="icon">ü¶â</span>  This document aims to specify all the requirements to contribute to Google Fonts. It ranges from the general knowledge required to contextualize the what and why of some of the requirements and the specifics regarding technical aspects with some suggestions on how to comply with them. Therefore, it covers different levels of information for both newcomers and more experienced contributors. If you are already familiar with some of the concepts, please feel free to jump to the other bits that you may be looking for.

## Introduction

-   **Libre Fonts Culture**

    You are contributing to an open-source based platform. It‚Äôs important for you to get familiar at least with the basics about [Libre Fonts Culture](culture.md)
-   **Typography & Fonts**

    Google Fonts expect font developers to understand the following:

    1.  Overall type design knowledge.
    2.  Basic understanding of how [fonts](https://simoncozens.github.io/fonts-and-layout/) and [OpenType Specification](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/opentype/spec/) works (skim read! focus on what each table does).
    3.  Proficiency in a fully featured font editor such as [Fontlab 7](https://www.fontlab.com/font-editor/fontlab/), [Glyphsapp](https://glyphsapp.com/), [Robofont](https://robofont.com/), or [Fontforge](https://fontforge.org/en-US/); not a toy editor like a "handwriting page scan to font" tool fix.
