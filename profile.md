## How to write the biography

    All the names present in [AUTHORS.txt](authors.md) will be credited in the font‚Äôs specimen page on Google Fonts. The names should be written with all necessary signs and marks to be considered correct.
-   **There is one bio per designer and per foundry mentioned.**
-   **The text should be around 100 words.**
-   **The text must be written in the 3rd person.**

### About section - Foundry information

## Registering a designer profile

You wrote a biography and you are happy with it. Now you want it to be added to Google Fonts so it appears in the `#About` section of the font family linked to that bio. As a designer or a foundry, you would just have [to submit it through this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1HinKkdCPbHTaiXxakeaUpDo1qsW3P9ZFemK65yWkru0/edit), and a team member will register the profile for you.

As a developer or a team member, you may want to know the process for registering or updating a new profile. You will find below all the necessary information to that effect.

### Technical requirements

-   **There is a directory per (moral/physical) person added.**
-   **There are all the necessary elements.**

    Each designer directories should have these 3 elements:

    ``` code
    .
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ info.pb
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ bio.html
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ image.png
    ```
-   **The directory is named correctly.**

    The directory should use the designer or the company‚Äôs name using ascii characters only and no hyphen.

    E.g `Jos√© Mar√≠a Ribagorda` ‚Üí `josemariaribagorda`
-   `info.pb` **has proper name and file path.**

    The info.pb is a file made to link a designer‚Äôs name to an image, and to a font.

    <div class="indented">

    -   The name should be spelled exactly the same as in a related [METADATA.pb](metadata.md) of a font (with all the necessary characters event accented letters). If not, the platform won‚Äôt be able to display the right profile on the right specimen page.

    

    -   The image file path should be the same as the one within the same directory.

    Example:

    ``` code
    designer: "Jos√© Mar√≠a Ribagorda"
    link: ""
    avatar {
      file_name: "josemariaribagorda.png"
    }
    ```

    </div>
-   **The image is formatted ready to use.**
    -   Should be a `PNG` or `JPEG` image between 100px and 300px. It will be cropped as a circle, so the image must be submitted as a square (1:1).

    

    -   The filename should be the same as the directory name (ascii characters only).
-   `bio.html` **contains all necessary informations.**

    The bio.html file is an HTML snippet (similar to the description file) that contains a short bio of the designer.

    -   Should contain a link to a webpage and/or social media profile: social media links are referenced as ‚ÄúTwitter‚Äù, ‚ÄúInstagram‚Äù etc, not as a name tag. Other web pages are displayed truncated from the protocol prefix.

    

    -   We recommend a bio length of around 100 words. So it should be more than 200 characters and less than 1000 characters.

    Example:

    ``` code
    <p>
    Jos√© Mar√≠a Ribagorda is coordinator of the Graphic Design Degree at the Escuela Superior de Dise√±o de Madrid. 
    He has a PhD in Image, Technology and Design from the Complutense University of Madrid.
    </p>
    <p>
    <a href="https://www.joseribagorda.com" target="_blank">joseribagorda.com</a> |
    <a href="https://twitter.com/Jm_ribagorda" target="_blank">Twitter</a>
    </p>
    ```

### Process for adding a designer

1.  Before adding the profile, make sure you have [cloned the google/fonts repo](making-pr.md) into your machine and [installed gftools in a virtual environment](tools.md).
2.  To simplify adding a new profile, we use `gftools add-designer` script that is part of `gftools`. It takes the different pieces of information and create a new directory in your local clone

    Team members have access to a spreadsheet linked to [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeMwHN8J213ZaxHrr5lHCrX56HY_NjGrWB8o604g98YxuMrdA/viewform). They can download the spreadsheet to add it as an argument; it will take the description and the link and format it correctly in `bio.html`.

    This is a common usage:

    ``` code
    gftools add-designer path/to/local/designer/dir "Jos√© Mar√≠a Ribagorda" --img_path path/to/josemariaribagorda.png --spreadsheet path/to/speadsheet.xls
    ```

    1.  If you don‚Äôt use the `--spreadsheet` argument, then the script will insert a blank `bio.html` that you will have to update manually.

    

    2.  If there are several links, make sure there are separated with a bar sign ` | `.
3.  You will need to make a manual Pull Request to GF to add the profile to the main repo. Follow [the guideline to make PR to google/fonts](making-pr.md).
    -   Please create one PR per profile.

    

    -   In your PR you should mention a font (one is sufficient) the profile is linked to.

    

    -   Don‚Äôt forget to add the labels `Designer profile` and `Ready for review`, and add the PR to Traffic Jam (cf [The onboarder workflow guide](onboarder-workflow.md)). A team member will review the PR and merge it. Once done, it should appear on the platform in 2-4 weeks.
