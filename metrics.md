# Vertical metrics

</div>

> <span class="icon">üê∏</span>  Vertical metrics are used to determine the space between two lines of text. Some metrics are meant for Mac, other for Windows; and are interpreted differently according to web or desktop usage.

Throughout countless threads and discussions, GF decided to make the priority on cross-platform compatibility and therefore apply the following requirements. Read them carefully because once a family is onbaorded, vertical metrics are meant to remain always remain the same to avoid regression, as mentioned in [Adding & upgrading fonts to Google Fonts](onboarding.md).

Please note that CJK fonts (Chinese-Japanese-Korean scripts) are treated as special cases, and should follow the instructions at the end of the document.

## Requirements for all fonts (except CJK)

The following rules apply to all new font families, and should be enforced to upgraded font families when possible.

**1. Vertical metrics must not be calculated by the font editor automatically.**

GF doesn't want this because they all do it differently.

**2. The following vertical metric parameters must be set for each font in a family.**

| \[OS/2\] usWinDescent   | winDescent                        | \[OS/2\] WinDescent    | openTypeOS2WinDescent    |

*For brevity, we'll refer to the 3 sets of metrics as* `Typo`*,* `Hhea`*,* `Win`*.*

**3. Vertical metrics must be consistent across a family.**

Each font in a family must share the same vertical metric values.

This rule can be avoided if a font is being upgraded and previously had inconsistent family metrics. If this is the case, the aim should be to visually match the line spacing of each font, but fix any clipping issues caused by incorrect `WinAscent`, `WinDescent` values.

**4. WinAscent and WinDescent values must be the same as the family's tallest/deepest yMin and yMax bounding box values.**

The Microsoft [OpenType specification](https://www.microsoft.com/typography/otspec/os2.htm#wa). Recommends the following:

> If any clipping is unacceptable, then the value should be set to `yMax`.

[Overpass issue \#33](https://github.com/RedHatBrand/Overpass/issues/33) demonstrates what happens in MS applications when the `winAscent` and `winDescent` are not set correctly.

By changing these values, the line height will be increased in MS applications. This is can lead to very loose line heights if the bounding box is exceedingly tall. This mainly occurs in families featuring Vietnamese, Devanagari and Arabic or other tall scripts. To counteract this, we enable the [Use Typo Metrics](https://www.microsoft.com/typography/otspec/os2.htm#fss) flag and set the `Typo` values to match the previous `Win` values. By swapping the sets, we should retain the previous line heights in Windows as well as remove the clipping.

**5.** **[Use_Typo_Metrics](https://www.microsoft.com/typography/otspec/os2.htm#fss)** **must be enabled.**

This will force MS Applications to use the `Typo` values instead of the `Win` values. By doing this, we can freely set the `Win` values to avoid clipping and control the line height with the `Typo` values. It has the added benefit of future line height compatibility. When a new script is added, we simply change the `Win` values to the new `yMin` and `yMax`, without needing to worry if the line height have changed. Note that the `Use_Typo_Metric` flag is also called `fsSelection bit 7 `(related to how it is set in the OS/2 table).

-   In Glyphs.app, set `Use_Typo_Metrics` custom parameter to `true` in the **Font** tab of **Font Info**.
-   In RoboFont, this is under **Font Info \> OpenType \> OS/2 Table \> fsSelection \> USE_TYPO_METRICS**.
-   In the OS/2 table: `<fsSelection value="00000000 10000000"/>`

**6. If the family is being updated, the line height must visually match the previous release.**

Some applications do not allow users to control the line height/leading of their fonts. Word processors and text editors are common culprits. It is essential their documents do not reflow.

**7. Hhea and Typo metrics should be equal.**

`Hhea` metrics are used in macOS, whilst Microsoft uses `Typo` when `Use_Typo_Metrics` is enabled. They should ideally be identical.

This rule can be avoided if a font is being upgraded and previously had inconsistent values.

**8. LineGap values must be 0.**

The `LineGap` value is a space added to the line height created by the union of the `(typo/hhea)Ascender` and `(typo/hhea)Descender`. It is handled differently according to the environment. This leading value will be added above the text line in most desktop apps. It will be shared above *and* under in web browsers, and ignored in Windows if `Use_Typo_Metrics` is disabled. For better linespacing consistency across platforms, `(typo/hhea)LineGap` values must be `0`.

**9. Uppercases should be centered if the font‚Äôs primary script has uppercases letterforms such as Latin, Greek and Cyrillic.**

Web designers will thank you if you managed to have the same space above and under capitals: `typoAscender - CapsHeight = abs(typoDescender)`. It will make easier for them the setting of padding in buttons for example.

**10. typo/hheaAscender value should be greater than Agrave's yMax when it makes sense.**

Some Mac applications such as TextEdit will position the first line of text by, either, using the height of the `A grave`, or by using the font‚Äôs `hheaAscender` (whichever is taller). To keep the positioning consistent across a family, we require that the `hheaAscender` is greater than the tallest `A grave` in the family. See this issue for further info, <https://github.com/googlefonts/fontbakery/issues/3170>.

**11. The sum of the font‚Äôs vertical metric values (absolute) should be 20-30% greater than the font‚Äôs UPM.**

By default, DTP applications such as Indesign will set the line height to be 20% greater than the font‚Äôs size (10pt size / 12pt leading). For consistency, we recommend setting the vertical metric values so their sum is in a similar range, for example:

``` code
UPM = 1000
(typo/hhea)Ascenders = 900
(typo/hhea)Descenders = -300
(typo/hhea)LineGap = 0

Total:
ascender + abs(descenders) + linegap = 1200
```

Exceptions are usually made if the font‚Äôs primary script isn‚Äôt Latin, Greek or Cyrillic. Some scripts such as Devanagari contain very tall and shallow glyphs. It may make more sense for the sum of the metrics to exceed 130% to avoid interline glyph collisions.

## Note

Please keep in mind that this calculation is to be set according to the specificities of each font.

-   The 120% suggested above is for compatibility with DTP apps. Still, it can often be too tight if your font covers more languages than basic Latin, Greek, and Cyrillic, or if you have a particular design with short ascenders.
-   The choice of the `Agrave` is purely based on the behaviour of some applications, it is not based on some general rules of design.
-   Google Fonts is trying to push designers to include proper support of the mark-to-mark feature allowing combination of diacritics and display of non-encoded accented glyphs. Pay attention to your anchor placement so that, if you combine breve and acute for example, you don't end up with a severe interline glyph clashing. Or adapt your vertical metrics with a certain measure, to find the best compromise.
-   Google Fonts wishes to update fonts to expand glyhpsets, and therefore language support, and therefore accessibility. If your intention is to have, for example, Vietnamese coverage or Thai script in a next update, you can already anticipate the vertical metrics to avoid regressions later.

For more info about the relationship between diacritics and line height, you can read this document: (to do: link Viviana's doc).

## Concrete cases:

Setting vertical metrics usually falls into the following two categories:

1.  Calculating the vertical metrics for a new family
2.  Recalculating the vertical metrics for an upgraded family

### 1. Calculating the vertical metrics for a new family

Set these values to be the same across all masters to ensure that output instances have equal vertical metrics:

-   `typoAscender` and `hheaAscender` set higher than `√Ä`
-   `typoLineGap` and `hheaLineGap` set to `0`
-   `typoDescender` and `hheaDescender` set lower than the deepest descender of the primary script.
-   `winAscent` and `winDecent` set to `yMax` and `yMin` (absolute highest and lowest point in the font)
-   `use_typo_metrics` is enabled

Expected result: vertical metrics should be around 120-130% of UPM. Anything greater, and the metrics may look too loose.

**Example**

A new Latin family has the following qualities:

-   UPM is `1000`
-   `yMax` of tallest `A grave` in the familly (bold for this example) = `940`
-   `yMin` of deepest a-z letter (`g` bold in this family) = `235`
-   Caps height (`H`or `Z` bbox height) = `730`
-   Family's `yMax = 1116` (Bold `A breve hookabove` for this family)
-   Family's `yMin = 320` (ExtraLight `c cedilla` for this family)

1.  Set the default values, following the schema above:

``` code
typoAscender = 965 #(UPM * 1.2 - CapsHeight) / 2 + CapsHeight which is greater than Agrave, perfect.)
typoDescender = -235 #(UPM * 1.2 - CapsHeight) / 2 which is equal to deepest letterform)
typoLineGap = 0
hheaAscender = 965 #(typoAscender)
hheaDescender = -235 #(typoDescender)
hheaLineGap = 0 #(typoLineGap)
winAscent = 1116 #(Font bbox yMax)
winDescent = 320 #(*absolute value* of Font bbox yMin ie. a positive integer)
```

1.  Be sure to copy these same metric values to all of the masters in the family
2.  Enable `Use_Typo_Metrics`

### 2. Recalculating the vertical metrics for an upgraded family

Many font families receive upgrades, either by the original author or a 3rd party. When character extensions occur which modify the font's bounding box, the vertical metrics will need to be recalculated.

Imagine we have a previous v1.000 release. We're now adding Vietnamese. The version number has been bumped to V2.000. The font's bbox `yMax` has changed from `1000` to `1100` and `yMin` from `-200` to `-300`.

v1.000 had the following family vertical metrics:

``` code
typoAscender = 800
typoDescender = -200
typoLineGap = 200
hheaAscender = 800
hheaDescender = -200
hheaLineGap = 200
winAscent = 1000
winDescent = 200
```

*Notice each set set adds up to 1200, if the negative integers are converted to positive. This should lead to consistent metrics across each platform*

There are two cases which can occur.

**I.** `Use_Typo_Metrics` **was already enabled in the v1.000 release.**

The Win values simply need to reflect the new `yMin` and `yMax` values.

1.  v2.000 vertical metrics:

    ``` code
    typoAscender = 800
    typoDescender = -200
    typoLineGap = 200
    hheaAscender = 800
    hheaDescender = -200
    hheaLineGap = 200
    WinAscent = 1100. # Font bbox yMax
    WinDescent = 300. # Font bbox yMin (positive integer)
    ```
2.  Repeat process for each weight/style if values are not unique in v1.000

**II.** `Use_Typo_Metrics` **was** ***not*** **enabled in the previous release.**

The Typo Metrics need to inherit the v1.000 Win values. The WinAscent and WinDescent also need to reflect the new yMin and yMax values.

1.  v2.000 vertical metrics:

    ``` code
    typoAscender = 1000. #Old WinAscent
    typoDescender = -200. #Old negative WinAscent
    typoLineGap = 0 #Win Metrics has no LineGap parameter so we set this to 0
    hheaAscender = 1000 #set as new TypoAscender)
    Hhea Descender = -200
    hheaLineGap = 0 #consistent with typoLineGap
    winAscent = 1100 #Font bbox yMax
    winDescent = 300 #Font bbox yMin positive integer
    ```
2.  Repeat process for each weight/style if values are not unique in v1.000
3.  Enable Use_Typo_Metrics

If the font was previously hosted on [fonts.google.com](http://fonts.google.com/), you can test the upgraded vertical metrics visually match by using [GF Regression](https://github.com/googlefonts/gfregression). You can also use gftools gen-html with the command `gftools gen-html diff --font-before font1.ttf --font-after font2.ttf` if you want to compare two fonts locally.

## CJK Vertical Metrics

CJK vertical metrics are based on Source Han Sans and Noto CJK fonts.

The following vertical metric values must be applied to all CJK fonts

| OS/2.fsSelection bit 7 (Use_Typo_Metrics) | Do not set / disabled                    | 0                          |

Our decision to follow the Adobe schema was based on Dr. Ken Lunde‚Äôs comments and his release notes on Source Han Sans:
